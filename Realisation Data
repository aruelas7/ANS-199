#Plot dog weight against the height

plot(dogs$height,dogs$weight)

#ggplot2 makes it easier to have different colors and change axis titles

#Data Visualitzation 
#Install packages
install.packages("ggplot2")

#Load package (every time you start R)
library("ggplot2")

#Grammer of Graphics -- We must layer our ggplot
#Layer 1: Enter the Data
ggplot(data=dogs)

#Layer #2: GEOMetry -- We need shapes to represent the data
#Geom_point will mean that we have a data point where needed (basically just a dot)
ggplot(data=dogs) + geom_point()

#Layer #3: AESthetic -- "wires" or "lines" between geometry and data (connects them)
ggplot(data=dogs) + geom_point(aes(x = datadog, y = popularity))

#Add another geom to add breed names to the plot
ggplot(data=dogs, aes(x = datadog, y= popularity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = breed))

#Add another geom to add breed names to the plot
ggplot(dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = breed)

#Add colors for each group (reference final code)
ggplot(dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity, color = Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = breed)

#Add color to points (add color to text in a similar way)
ggplot(dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Group)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = breed)

#Adjust the text, so it's not on top of points. You can modify text alignment 
#with vjust and hjust aesthetics. 
#Possible characters are "left", "middle", "right", "bottom", "center", "top"

#Layer 5: Add Labels (labs)
ggplot(dogs, aes(x = datadog, y = popularity, color = Groups)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = breed), hjust = "left", vjust = "top") +
  labs(title = "Best in Show", x = "Computed DataDog Score", y = "AKC Popularity Ranking")

#This will allow you to capitalize group within your plot or change the heading in any way you'd like
Groups= dogs$group

#Now save the plot you have created to your working directory with: 
ggsave("dogs_plot.png")


#Bar plot -- this is the question for homework
ggplot(dogs, aes(x = Group, fill= Size)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

Size= dogs$size
Group= dogs$group

ggsave("dogs_barplot.png")
